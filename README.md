import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CalendarDays } from "lucide-react";

export function AppealStatusCard({ appeal }) {
  // Determine status color based on appeal status
  const getStatusColor = (status) => {
    switch (status) {
      case "pending": return "bg-amber-500/15 text-amber-700 dark:text-amber-400";
      case "approved": return "bg-emerald-500/15 text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400";

      default: return "bg-slate-100 text-slate-800 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-300";
    }
  };

  return (

          </Badge>
        </div>
        <CardDescription className="text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400">

      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="space-y-2">

    </Card>
  );
}
```

#### Officer Statement Analyzer Interface

The Officer Statement Analyzer uses advanced text highlighting with interactive margin notes:

```tsx

export function OfficerStatementAnalyzer() {
  const [statement, setStatement] = useState("");
  const [analysis, setAnalysis] = useState(null);
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("statement");
  
  // Simulated analysis result structure
  const analyzedText = [
    { 
      text: "I observed the vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed.", 
      issue: "Vague language - 'high rate of speed' is subjective without specific measurement",
      strength: "high",
      color: "bg-amber-500/15 border-l-amber-500"
    },
    { 
      text: "I visually estimated the speed before confirming with radar.", 
      issue: "Procedural weakness - visual estimation has lower evidentiary value",
      strength: "medium",
      color: "bg-blue-500/15 border-l-blue-500"
    },
    // More analysis items...
  ];
  
  const handleAnalyze = () => {
    // In a real implementation, this would call an API with the statement
    // For demo purposes, we'll just set a mock result
    setAnalysis({
      score: 78,
      issuesFound: analyzedText.length,
      criticalIssues: 2,
      appealPotential: "Strong"
    });
    setActiveTab("analysis");
  };

  return (

        </Tabs>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

#### Responsive Design Implementation

The No Más Multas interface implements responsive design patterns that maintain the shadcn/ui New York variant aesthetic across devices:

```tsx
// Example of responsive layout component
export function AppealDashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 p-2 md:p-4">
      {/* Sidebar - collapses to top bar on mobile */}
      <aside className="md:col-span-1 lg:col-span-1 flex flex-col space-y-4 order-1">
        <Card className="border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-800 shadow-sm">
          <CardHeader className="py-3">
            <CardTitle className="text-base font-medium">Appeal Progress</CardTitle>
          </CardHeader>
          <CardContent>
            {/* Progress indicators */}
            <div className="space-y-2">
              {/* Responsive progress steps that stack vertically on mobile */}
              <div className="hidden md:block">
                {/* Desktop vertical progress steps */}
              </div>
              <div className="block md:hidden">
                {/* Mobile horizontal progress steps */}
              </div>
            </div>
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      </aside>
      
      {/* Main content area - full width on mobile */}
      <main className="md:col-span-2 lg:col-span-3 order-2 md:order-2">
        {children}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Interactive UI Elements

The interface incorporates subtle animations and interactive elements that enhance usability while maintaining the refined New York variant aesthetic:

```tsx
// Button with loading state and micro-interaction
import { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Loader2 } from "lucide-react";

export function AnalyzeButton({ onClick }) {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    await onClick();
    setLoading(false);
  };

  return (
    <Button 
      onClick={handleClick}
      disabled={loading}
      className="relative bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white transition-all duration-200 
                overflow-hidden group"
    >
      {loading ? (
        <Loader2 className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin mr-2" />
      ) : (
        <span className="group-hover:translate-x-1 transition-transform duration-200 inline-flex items-center">
          Analyze
          <svg 
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" 
            className="h-4 w-4 ml-1 opacity-70 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity" 
            fill="none" 
            viewBox="0 0 24 24" 
            stroke="currentColor"
          >
            <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M9 5l7 7-7 7" />
          </svg>
        </span>
      )}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

#### Color System Implementation

The shadcn/ui New York variant uses a sophisticated color system that balances aesthetics with functional requirements:

```tsx
// Theme configuration with semantic color mapping
const colors = {
  // Base colors
  primary: {
    50: '#f0f6fe',
    100: '#dceafe',
    200: '#bdd4fe',
    300: '#90b5fc',
    400: '#608df8',
    500: '#3a66f3',
    600: '#2648e5',
    700: '#1e3ad0',
    800: '#1e32a8',
    900: '#1e3184',
    950: '#172056',
  },
  // Additional colors...
  
  // Semantic mappings
  appeal: {
    weak: '#ef4444',    // red-500
    moderate: '#f59e0b', // amber-500
    strong: '#10b981',  // emerald-500
  },
  
  status: {
    pending: '#f59e0b',  // amber-500
    approved: '#10b981', // emerald-500
    rejected: '#ef4444', // red-500
    deadline: '#f43f5e', // rose-500
  },
  
  element: {
    card: {
      light: 'white',
      dark: '#0f172a', // slate-950
    },
    input: {
      border: {
        light: '#e2e8f0', // slate-200
        dark: '#334155',  // slate-700
      },
      bg: {
        light: 'white',
        dark: '#0f172a',  // slate-950
      }
    },
    // Additional elements...
  }
};

// Usage example for consistent coloring
function StatusBadge({ status }) {
  return (
    <Badge 
      className={`
        ${status === 'pending' ? 'bg-amber-500/15 text-amber-700 dark:text-amber-400' : ''}
        ${status === 'approved' ? 'bg-emerald-500/15 text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400' : ''}
        ${status === 'rejected' ? 'bg-rose-500/15 text-rose-700 dark:text-rose-400' : ''}
      `}
    >
      {status}
    </Badge>
